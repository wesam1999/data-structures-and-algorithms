# Stacks and Queues
i should create Stacks and queue have method for Stacks<br />
1.pop<br />
2.peek<br />
3.is empty<br />
4.push<br />
for Queue:<br />
1.dequeue<br />
2.enqueue<br />
3.peek<br />
4.is empty<br />
## Challenge
## Stack
The class should contain the following methods:<br />
push<br />
Arguments: value<br />
adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.<br />
pop<br />
Arguments: none<br />
Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack<br />
Removes the node from the top of the stack<br />
Should raise exception when called on empty stack<br />
peek<br />
Arguments: none<br />
Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack<br />
Should raise exception when called on empty stack<br />
is empty<br />
Arguments: none<br />
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.<br />
## Queue

The class should contain the following methods:<br />
enqueue<br />
Arguments: value<br />
adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.<br />
dequeue<br />
Arguments: none<br />
Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue<br />
Removes the node from the front of the queue<br />
Should raise exception when called on empty queue<br />
peek<br />
Arguments: none<br />
Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue<br />
Should raise exception when called on empty stack<br />
is empty<br />
Arguments: none<br />
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty<br />


## Approach & Efficiency
the Big O
1.pop<br />
O(1)for space and time
2.peek<br />
O(1)for space and time
3.is empty<br />
O(1)for space and time
4.push<br />
O(1)for space and time
for Queue:<br />
1.dequeue<br />
O(1)for space and time
2.enqueue<br />
O(1)for space and time
3.peek<br />
O(1)for space and time
4.is empty<br />
O(1) for space and time
## API
for Stack:<br />
1.pop<br />
to is used to remove the node from the top <br />
2.peek<br />
used to retrieve or fetch the first element of the Stack or the element present at the top of the Stack.<br />
3.is empty<br />
it is used to check that if the Stack is empty.<br />
4.push<br />
it is used to add new node to the Stacks
for Queue:<br />
1.dequeue<br />
it is used to  removal of elements from either end of the data structure<br />
2.enqueue<br />
it is used to add new node to the queue.<br />
3.peek<br />
used to retrieve or fetch the first element of the Stack or the element present at the top of the queue.<br />
4.is empty<br />
it is used to check that if the Stack is empty.<br />
