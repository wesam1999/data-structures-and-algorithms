# Depth First Traversal
Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.<br />
The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph)<br />
and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.<br />

## Challenge
create a method that Conducts a depth-first preorder traversal on a graph<br />

## Approach & Efficiency
O(n)for space <br />
O(1)for time<br />
