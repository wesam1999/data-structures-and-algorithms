## Graphs
In math, a graph can be defined as a pictorial representation or a diagram that represents data or values in an organized manner. 
The points on the graph often represent the relationship between two or more things.

## Challenge
add node
Arguments: value
Returns: The added node
Add a node to the graph
add edge
Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
Returns: nothing
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
If specified, assign a weight to the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
get nodes
Arguments: none
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
get neighbors
Arguments: node
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
size
Arguments: none
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
