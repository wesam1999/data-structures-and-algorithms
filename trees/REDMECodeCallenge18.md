If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”<br />
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”<br />
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”<br />
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.<br />
